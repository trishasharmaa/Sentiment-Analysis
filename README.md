# Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, titled "Sentiment Analyser," we explore sentiment analysis using textual data. Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone behind words, providing insights into the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed within a dataset.

The dataset used in this analysis is derived from Twitter data scraped in February 2015. Contributors were asked to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, and further categorize negative tweets by reasons such as "late flight" or "rude service." This dataset, containing 55,000 rows of non-aggregated results, was made available through CrowdFlower's Data for Everyone initiative and can be accessed https://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/.

I employ various sentiment lexicons such as AFINN, Bing, and NRC to classify words as positive, negative, or associated with specific emotions like sadness, anger, and fear. By processing the text data with tools like tm and tidytext, we create a structured representation that allows for insightful visualizations and analysis of sentiment trends across the dataset.
